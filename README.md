### Classification btw brain activities in EEG signal via NN & RBF

- A) Calculate the introduced feature or any other feature that you write (for different channels of training data. Normalize the feature matrices.
- B) Using a criterion based on the distribution matrix or any other criterion You smell like sand. Select the best features. For this, you can consider the categories of statistical and frequency domain features separately and choose the best one in each category.
- C) Design an MLP network and train it using a set of different features and calculate the average of the 5-fold cross-validation of the classifier using the method. By changing the numbers, the number of layers, the number of neurons in each layer, the active function of the neurons, and changing the groups, you can try to design the best MLP of the selected feature.
